## Platform Engineering Code Assessment

1. Rank each of the following languages and frameworks on a 4 point scale, where 1 = "I've been paid to write production quality code with it." and 4 = "I could write a Hello World web application if I had a tutorial."

- JQuery 2
- Python 3
- PHP 3
- Scala 4
- Clojure 2
- Haskell 4
- Golang 4
- Node.js 2
- Ruby 2
- Perl 1
- Java 1
- Angular 3
- Chef. 2

1. In any language of your choice, write a utility that will translate a hexadecimal string to base64. Here's a test: this string `45766964696e74` should be converted into this string `RXZpZGludA==`.
1. Download this [simple Python script](https://github.com/SignalPath/CodeTests/blob/master/specialMath.py). When you run it from the command line, it takes one parameter. So `$> python specialMath.py 7` will produce `79`. Also, `$> python specialMath.py 17` will produce `10926`. This question has two parts: first, convert it to Scala; second, have the script calculate `$> specialMath 90`.
