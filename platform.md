1. Rank each of the following languages and frameworks on a 4 point scale, where 1 = "I've been paid to write production quality code with it." and 4 = "I could write a Hello World web application if I had a tutorial."
  * Scala
  * Java
  * Python
  * Clojure
  * Haskell
  * Kotlin
  * Golang
  * Rust
  * Groovy
  * Node.js
  * Ruby
  * Angular
  * Helm
  * Terraform
  * MQL (MongoDB Query Language)
  * SQL
  
1. In any language of your choice, write a utility that will translate a hexadecimal string to base64. Here's a test: this string `45766964696e74` should be converted into this string `RXZpZGludA==`.
1. Download this [simple Python script](https://github.com/SignalPath/CodeTests/blob/master/specialMath.py). When you run it from the command line, it takes one parameter. So `$> python specialMath.py 7` will produce `79`. Also, `$> python specialMath.py 17` will produce `10926`. This question has two parts: first, convert it to Scala; second, have the script calculate `$> specialMath 90`.
