1. Choose one of the following coding exercises.
 - Using this [JSON data source](http://api.lillycoi.com/v1/trials?limit=100) create an Angular application that shows the list of 100 trials in sortable grid. The user should be able to page through the results.  The columns of the grid should be "brief_title", "lead_sponsor" and "completion_date".  For a given trial, the user should be able to navigate to the appropriate page on `clinicaltrials.gov` for that trial using the following url pattern `http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/{id}`
 - Extend the popular [Angular ToDo MVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/angularjs/#/) such that an entry (to do) can be assigned a priority (high, medium, low).  Upon completion of an entry (to do) the user may optionally provide a date on which the entry was completed.
